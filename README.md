## Extension info

This will **not** replace your new tab. The reason for this is the permission for replacing the new tab is not optional, so users cannot turn it off, but you can always set your homepage manually to this extension.

**No third party cloud storage.**
It stores all of the data in your Chrome's sync storage. This is tied to your Google account, and you can sync it across your browsers that use your Google account (eg. Chrome, Chromium) but nothing else.

#### Planned features:

- notes
- some hotkeys
- undo/redo
- multiple task lists
- unicode icon/emoji selector
- storage usage indicator/settings (sync storage is very limited)
